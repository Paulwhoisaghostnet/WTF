## 2026-04-30 — Timeline and DM credit explosion from live-heavy design

**What happened**: The W microapp had almost no durable persistence for the two most expensive paths: timeline (`/api/w/timeline`) and DM/groupchat reads. Timeline was entirely in-process memory + client refetch every 60s. DM paths had good DB tables but many routes still preferred live X calls, with short in-memory caches that cleared on restart. Every reboot, tab switch, or refresh triggered full X API calls, rapidly burning credits (especially when the user was testing heavily).

**Why it mattered**: X Pay-Per-Use pricing makes every `/users/{id}/tweets` and `/dm_conversations/.../dm_events` call expensive. Without DB-first reads and longer cache TTLs, the app became a credit black hole. The "no posts on timeline" symptom was the direct result of the bearer token expiring after credit exhaustion.

**Fix**: 
- Added `x_timeline_posts` table with indexes for fast lookup by author and time.
- Made `/api/w/timeline` DB-first (`loadTimelineFromDb` before any live call), with automatic persist on successful live fetch.
- Increased DM/groupchat cache TTLs (fresh 10min, stale 4h for public mirror).
- Forced groupchat route to DB-only path for all users (public read-only mirror).
- Updated types, diagnostics, UI labels ("Cached for Credit Efficiency"), and added staleness indicators.
- Strengthened spam filtering (1-participant = ignore) and ensured per-user OAuth isolation.
- No changes to OAuth paths (only platform token for timeline/public groupchat, user tokens for private inboxes).

**Rule**: For any Pay-Per-Use API, default to DB-first reads with background writers. In-memory cache is only a hot layer on top of durable storage. Always expose cache age and rate-limit status to the user. Measure credit burn before adding polling or frequent refreshes. This pattern (DB cache + background sync + visible staleness) is the battle-tested way to keep social features affordable.

**Impact**: Timeline and groupchat now survive restarts and heavy use with near-zero incremental credit cost. DM inboxes remain private and user-scoped.
